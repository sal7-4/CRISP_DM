# Seattle-Airbnb-Data
Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project:
A sneak peek into the Airbnb activity in Seattle, WA, USA
### Introduction
This project is about to understand how much AirBNB homes are earning in certain time frames and areas and practicing the CRISP-DM process.

### Project Datasets
I used Seattle Airbnb Open Data on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)to answer the questions I would like to explore. The dataset includes:
- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day
### Key Steps of the Projects
1. Come up with three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.
2. Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages to:
- Prepare data:
    - Gather necessary data to answer the questions
    - Handle categorical and missing data
    - Provide insight into the methods and why I chose them
    
- Analyze, Model, and Visualize
    - Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them.

3. Communicate business insights
